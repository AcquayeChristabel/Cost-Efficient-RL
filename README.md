# Cost-Efficient-RL

This project is done for the CMSC 742 Course Project. This repository contains files for running a comparative study on Chosen RL algorithms for the Gridworld and WaterWorld Environment.

The folders have been labeled to indicate the codes for the specific algorithms 

The reuslts folder contains outputs for running all three selected algorithms on the chosed environments
